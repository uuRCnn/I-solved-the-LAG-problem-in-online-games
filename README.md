# My-solution-for-LAG-problem-in-online-games

In my own game, I was experiencing lag delays of 1.5 to 2.0 seconds, and I tried every method, but the solution I found myself is incredibly good. I managed to reduce the delays to 0.3 seconds, and its usage is extremely simple, consisting of no more than 15 lines of code. And in this method, we are not using the Network Transform Component; we are replicating its core functionality with the code here.

I shot a 4-minute YouTube video, you can watch how it is used there.
